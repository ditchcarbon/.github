Welcome to [DitchCarbon's](https://ditchcarbon.com)  organisation on Github where we're working to build emissions data into everything :) 
- We collect emission data, normalise then and provide it in a modern REST API to help organizations integrate carbon emissions into thier decisions everyday to meet their sustainability goals.
  
- Only by making business decisions climate conscious can we drive down emissions fast enough, this is just too big for sustainability departments to handle on their own.

- We capture emission data on companies, products and activities then present these wherever decisions are being made, in your procurement, ERP, accounting or our own online tools. 

- We're always keen to chat to potential integration partners so please do get in touch Enquiries@ditchcarbon.com
